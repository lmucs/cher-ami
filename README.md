CherAmi is a social sharing application with a number of features to control sharing with their [dearest friends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher_Ami) in a simple, fun, and secure way, and, in the case of celebrity users, monetize their fanbase. Participants can post text, image and video content, decide whether postings are free or paid, embed secret messages in content, enable content locking and expiration, and gain reputation via activity within the app. In addition, celebrities can expose content (backstage passes, discounted tickets, signed photos, songs, early access) only to fans with a minimum reputation.

This project was developed as part of the Software Engineering Laboratory course at Loyola Marymount University during the 2014 fall semester.
